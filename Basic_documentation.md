## What am I making?
I am creating a treasure/loot generator for my home games of dungeons and dragons run in the 3.5 edition of the game.
## Why am I making it?
I think that the generators online are "Janky" or "confusing" and I would like to be able to generate large ammounts of treasure for my
games without having to roll dice cross referencing to a book and needing to flip through pages for 10 minutes.
## How will I be making it?
I will be using Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a clean and functional programme. I am using javascript due to its very versatile handling of arrays and objects.
HTML and CSS will be used as a method of visual reresentation and deployment. I intend on making this an open source project so that users can add items into a custom user 
database or even create their own for their homebrew games, this is to keep in the theme of "It's your game" that d&d strongly holds.
## Which SDLC will I be using?
I will be using the "Waterfall" design approach as it is easy to follow and the steps to develop this app are quite logical and straight forward.
## Waterfall
1. create an object containing random objects from the 3.5 dungeon masters guide treasure section under the level 1 party section.
2. Create a randomizing function that adds data from the objects into an array which will be printed, this will be looped for a number of times set by the user.
3. add all of the item stats from the guide book into the objects which will show when the user hovers over the items generated along with a basic universal image relating to the item  type.
4. use html and css to make the layout of the app appealing and have a cool d&d style.
5. Add the rest of the database of objects and data from the game guie book.
